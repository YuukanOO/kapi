# kapi - Living documentation made easy!

/!\ This is an early Work In Progress!

## How does it work?

**It does not work yet!**

Kapi uses `kss-node` and `apidoc-core` to parse your source code and to generate json files ready to be read.

Those files are then processed by a custom `metalsmith` plugin to generate a static website covering both your REST APIs and your styleguide.
